    "Description": "Summons an object towards the caster. It is able to summon objects in direct line of sight of the caster, as well as things out of view, by calling the object aloud after the incantation (unless the spell is casted nonverbally). This spell needs thought behind it, and the object must be clear in the casters mind before trying to summon it. The caster doesn't necessarily need to know the location of the target if they say the name of the object to be summoned, such as when Hermione Granger summoned some books from Dumbledore's office simply by saying \"Accio Horcrux books!\" while in Gryffindor Tower.",
    "Mention": "Harry Potter summoned his broom to complete the first task of the Triwizard Tournament in 1994, and to summon the Portkey to escape Voldemort and the Death Eaters in the Little Hangleton Graveyard in 1995.

    "Mention": "Voldemort used this spell twice; firstly in 1943 upon his uncle Morfin Gaunt, then sometime later on the house-elf Hokey. Both instances were to hide his crimes and make the victims believe they were responsible. It is likely that Kingsley Shacklebolt used this spell on Marietta Edgecombe in 1996 in order to prevent her from revealing Dumbledore's Army to Cornelius Fudge. This is reinforced by Dumbledore stating that Shacklebolt was \"remarkably quick on the uptake\" in modifying her memory. It is possible that Professor Horace Slughorn used this in the next school year to hide his memory of Voldemort asking him about Horcruxes, although as he retained awareness of the true memory his spell may be a different one. It is also possible that he simply repressed it to such a degree that it could not be extracted from him against his will, as the memory he gave Dumbledore simple went blank at the right times and was replaced by a disembodied shouting, rather than images; this was noted to be crudely done. Hermione Granger used this in 1997 to make her parents believe they were named Wendell and Monica Wilkins respectively, that they have no daughter, and to make them move to Australia in order to protect them from Voldemort and his Death Eaters.",

Wands are also irreparable, as shown in 1992 when Ron's wand snapped after he and Harry crashed onto the Hogwarts grounds. Despite his use of Spellotape, Ron's wand malfunctioned throughout the year. Another example is in 1997 when Hermione tried to fix Harry's broken wand, which was snapped by her errant Blasting Curse. However, Harry repaired his wand with the Elder Wand. Since the Elder Wand is the most powerful wand in creation, it makes sense that it would produce the most powerful Mending Charm."

The movement of the wand seems to affect how someone is cut, suggested by the erratic patterns of slashes left on Draco Malfoy's face and chest, produced by Harry Potter's wild wand-swings while using the spell against Draco. Wounds caused by this spell can be healed as proved by Severus Snape who after Harry hit Draco Malfoy with this spell he healed Draco's wounds and told him to go and get treated with dittany at once so that he would even avoid any sign of any wound.
